discord bot that plays Holy Quran chapters in different reciters voice,  
this bot wrriten in java using JDA discord wrapper and lavaplayer with some utils.  

it's free but not fully completed and i have hope to complete it, as soon as i got free time.  
also i'm planing to write documention and hosting guide.  

here's some things i'm planing to do in the future.    
- create search command that searchs for specifed surah (chapter) or reciter  
- create skip command that skips the current surah.  
- create all command which plays all the specified surha(s)  
- making the bot more easy and comfortable  

use this bot at your own risk i'm not responsiable for any bad use of this bot.
